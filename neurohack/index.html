            Advanced Neuroscience Workshop

         <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
             Boston Precision Brain & Mental Health Hack is a three-day event happening at Northeastern University this Fall designed as an extension to Brainhack Global. This event will bring together students, postdocs, and faculty to tackle precision medicine problems through hackathon-style projects, hands-on tutorials, and discussions. Following the Brainhack spirit, this hackathon is not a “coding sprint” or exclusive to programmers—neuroscientists, psychologists, engineers, programmers, students, faculty, and more can and do make a significant contribution to the event. Given some methodological overlap and goals,
             we are excited to incorporate both digital health and neuroscience approaches.

                    Dr. Robinaugh’s work is focused on investigating the complex systems that give rise to anxiety and traumatic-stress disorders, especially prolonged grief. The premise of his work is that mental disorders are massively complex phenomena that arise from a host of interacting biological, psychological, social, cultural, and environmental factors. To understand these complex systems, Dr. Robinaugh utilizes a broad set of tools from psychology, systems science, and art + design, including dynamical systems modeling, network psychometric modeling, and computational phenotyping, with particular focus on applying these tools with time series data collected in the laboratory, in extended reality, and in ecological momentary assessments.

Her program of research focuses on investigating the etiology, assessment, and treatment of comorbid Affective Disorders and Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs). In July 2008 she received the Zinberg Fellowship Award from HMS to study psychosocial interventions for college students with binge drinking and depressive symptoms. She is the principal investigator of a study examining neural substrates of binge drinking in young adults and a study on reward processes among young adults with dual diagnoses. In 2009 she was appointed director of the DCRP dual diagnoses studies. She has been actively involved at a local and national level in disseminating awareness of the negative consequences of the co-occurrence of depressive symptoms and AUDs among college students by presenting at national conferences and conducting in service presentations in college campuses. She is the Co- Investigator of a NIH funded study investigating innovative technologies for the assessment of depressive symptoms. She is an Affiliate Assistant Professor at Clark University where she provides clinical supervision on treatments for dual diagnoses patients to students in the Doctoral Clinical Psychology Program.

        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">No - there are no prerequisites.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Why should I participate in a hackathon?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Hackathons are a great way to learn new skills that will be useful in your everyday work as a researcher. Beyond that, hackathons are also an opportunity to meet, collaborate and exchange best practices with members of the community.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Is there a registration deadline for the Brainhack?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">No. However, our event space has a strict capacity, so space is limited.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Will this event have a virtual option?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Yes. However, please note that in previous years over 95% of attendees have participated in person. Additionally, while we will do our best to actively monitor virtual streams, some event spaces are not equipped with cameras and/or microphones.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Who should I reach out to if I have questions?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Please email Alex Fischbach &lt;<a href="mailto:fischbach.a@northeastern.edu">fischbach.a@northeastern.edu</a>&gt;</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">How is this year's Brainhack different from previous years?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">This year, we are incorporating hackathon projects into the three-day schedule.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">What is a hackathon project?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">A project developed during the event, where participants work in teams to create a tool, analysis, experiment, or idea related to the hackathon's theme. Projects can range from coding and data analysis to designing workflows, visualizations, or community resources. The focus is on creativity, learning, and collaboration rather than polished end products or technical coding/programming skills.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">I don't want to submit/pitch a project, but I want to contribute. How does this work?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">At the hackathon, each project leader will pitch at the beginning of the event. Then you will have the possibility to chat with the project leaders before you decide which projects to join.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: black;">Submitting a Hackathon Project</h3>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Who can submit a hackathon project?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Anyone registered for Brainhack can submit a project to the project pool. It might be either a project you are already working on and would like help with or a completely new project you would like to start.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Where can I find examples of previous brainhack projects?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">

        </p>


        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">I want to submit a hackathon project. What information do you need?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">In this Google form there will be a section that asks you to provide: (1) the title of your project and (2) a description of your project (1-2 sentences).</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Does my project idea need to be fully formed?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">No! Brainhack projects are typically broad/general at the beginning, and then become more refined throughout the hackathon, as other collaborators contribute to the project.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">What is the deadline for project submission?</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2rem;">We will close project submission before the Brainhack starts, but we recommend you send a draft submission earlier, if possible.</p>
