title: About me
---
I'm a postdoctoral associate at [Yale University Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging](https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/) working on computational and statistical tools that will help us conduct more accurate research in human neuroscience. One of my main goals has been to investigate test-retest reliability of functional connectivity and its implications, since reliability is one cornerstone of accurate inference. Another goal has been to characterize validity of standard mass univariate tools used for inference in both network and activation mapping; this helps us both understand the strengths and limitations of existing tools as well as form a benchmark for new tools. A final goal has been to build upon our emerging understanding of fMRI reliability and validity to create tools that enable more accurate inference and benchmarking. The overarching motivation for all this is easily appreciated: more accurate research tools lead us closer to discovery in disease and in health.
