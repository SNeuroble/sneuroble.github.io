The following projects are geared towards understanding existing research methods and creating more accurate research tools in fMRI.

**The Constrained Network-Based Statistic: A New Level of Inference for Neuroimaging**
Current multiple comparison correction procedures for functional connectivity inference do not account for dependence between non-contiguous connections or spatial bias arising from differences in measurements across the brain. This project seeks to address these limitations with a new a priori network-based multiple comparison correction approach, establish its empirical utility in the context of other correction approaches, and maximize its impact through modern open science practices.
_Funded by NIMH K00MH122372_

**Improving Reliability and Validity of fMRI Statistical Methods**
Recent work has raised questions about the reliability and validity of major fMRI statistical methods. The first part of this project addressed open questions regarding the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity. The second part of this project evaluated sensitivity of common cluster-based inference methods used in activation mapping.
