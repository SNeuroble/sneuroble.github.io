<!-- <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="+2"><b>About me</b></font></p> -->
<p align="justify">
I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/psychology/">Psychology Department</a>, <a href="https://bioe.northeastern.edu/"> Bioengineering Department</a>, and <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/cbhlab/">Center for Cognitive and Brain Health</a> at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a> and a Research Affiliate in the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/">Radiology & Biomedical Imaging Department</a> in the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/">Yale School of Medicine</a> creating computational and statistical tools for precision neuroscience research. My use of "precision neuroscience" is intended to invoke both measurement theory and precision medicine concepts.
<br><br>
My research aims to use <b>fundamental measurement principles</b> and <b>individual-centered methods</b> to advance <b>brain-behavior understanding and prediction</b>. To set the stage for this research program, I have developed approaches to improve detection of brain-behavior relationships based on my work characterizing measurement and signal properties. Furthermore, I have a longstanding commitment to providing <b>best practices for machine learning and big data analysis</b>, especially for predicting psychiatric and developmental outcomes. The overarching motivation for these goals is one that the field is growing to embrace: more precise inferential and predictive methods are needed to accelerate discovery in health and disease. Many neuroscience-related research areas have faced an explosion in the size and complexity of data and methods, and I aim to explore solutions to problems that span disciplines.
<br><br>
I previously completed my BSE in <a href=https://cbe.princeton.edu/>Chemical and Biological Engineering</a> at <a href=https://www.princeton.edu/>Princeton University</a>, my PhD in the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/INP/">Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program</a> at <a href="https://www.yale.edu/">Yale University</a> with <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/todd-constable">Dr. Todd Constable</a>, and my Postdoctoral Research in the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/">Radiology & Biomedical Imaging Department</a> at the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/">Yale School of Medicine</a> with <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/dustin-scheinost">Dr. Dustin Scheinost</a>.
My experiences also extend beyond academia: before the PhD, I was co-founding Chief Scientific Officer of goBlue Labs (<a href="https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/start-up_tries_to_tap_mind_power/">selected media</a> and <a href="https://www.cravingtoquit.com/">Craving to Quit</a> product; now <a href="https://www.inknowvation.com/sbir/companies/mindsciences-inc">Mindsciences</a>), and a consultant for <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311720">Source Signal Imaging</a> (now part of <a href="https://cortechsolutions.com/">Cortech Solutions</a>). I am currently a consultant for <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_va/11128712">Elite Warrior Identification</a>.
