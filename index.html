<!-- <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="+2"><b>About me</b></font></p> -->
<p align="justify">
I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/">Yale University Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging</a> (soon-to-be Assistant Professor at Northeastern; see below) creating computational and statistical tools for precision neuroscience research, mentored by <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/dustin-scheinost">Dustin Scheinost</a>. My use of "precision neuroscience" is intended to invoke both measurement theory and precision medicine concepts.
<br><br>
My research aims to use <b>fundamental measurement principles</b> and <b>individual-centered methods</b> to advance <b>brain-behavior understanding and prediction</b>. To set the stage for this research program, I have developed approaches to improve detection of brain-behavior relationships based on my work characterizing measurement and signal properties. Furthermore, I have a longstanding commitment to providing <b>best practices for machine learning and big data analysis</b>, especially for predicting psychiatric and developmental outcomes. The overarching motivation for these goals is one that the field is growing to embrace: more precise inferential and predictive methods are needed to accelerate discovery in health and disease. Many neuroscience-related research areas have faced an explosion in the size and complexity of data and methods, and I aim to explore solutions to problems that span disciplines.
<br><br>
The foundation for this work began during my PhD in the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/INP/">Yale Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program</a> with <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/todd-constable">Todd Constable</a>.
My experiences also extend beyond academia: before the PhD, I was co-founding Chief Scientific Officer of goBlue Labs (<a href="https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/start-up_tries_to_tap_mind_power/">selected media</a> and <a href="https://www.cravingtoquit.com/">Craving to Quit</a> product; now <a href="https://www.starthub.org/startups/claritas-mindsciences">Mindsciences</a>), and a consultant for <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311720">Source Signal Imaging</a> (now part of <a href="https://cortechsolutions.com/">Cortech Solutions</a>). I am currently a consultant for <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_va/11128712">Elite Warrior Identification</a>.
<br><br>
Want to get in touch? I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations&mdash;don't hesitate to contact me through any of the links below.
<br>I will also be joining the <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/cbhlab/">Northeastern University Center for Cognitive and Brain Health</a> as an Assistant Professor in the Departments of <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/psychology/">Psychology</a> and <a href="https://bioe.northeastern.edu/">Bioengineering</a> starting July 2023, so I will be hiring soon! Advertisements forthcoming; in the meantime, don't hesitate to shoot me an email with any inquiries about potential lab manager, postdoc, or student opportunities.
