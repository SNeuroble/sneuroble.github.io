## About me

I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at [Yale University Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging](https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/) working with [Dustin Scheinost](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/dustin-scheinost) on computational and statistical tools that will help us conduct more reproducible research in human neuroscience. 
Much of my work has focused on characterizing reliability and validity of both network and activation mapping in fMRI. In addition, my research builds upon our emerging understanding of these topics to create tools that enable more accurate inference and benchmarking. The overarching motivation for these goals is one that the field is growing to embrace: more accurate research methods lead us closer to discovery in health and disease.

The foundation for that work began during my PhD in the Yale Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program](https://medicine.yale.edu/INP/) with [Todd Constable](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/todd-constable).
I also dabbled in entrepreneurship before the PhD---I was the co-founding Chief Scientific Officer of goBlue Labs (media [here](https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/start-up_tries_to_tap_mind_power/); now [Mindsciences](https://www.starthub.org/startups/claritas-mindsciences)) where we launched the product [Craving to Quit](https://www.cravingtoquit.com/) and created software for EEG-based source estimation and neurofeedback; then I and worked as a consultant for [Source Signal Imaging](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311720) (now part of [Cortech Solutions](https://cortechsolutions.com/)).
