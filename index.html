<!-- <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="+2"><b>About me</b></font></p> -->
<p align="justify">
We are a lab in the <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/psychology/">Psychology Department</a>, <a href="https://bioe.northeastern.edu/"> Bioengineering Department</a>, and <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/cbhlab/">Center for Cognitive and Brain Health</a> at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a> creating computational and statistical tools for precision neuroscience research. Our use of "precision neuroscience" is intended to invoke both measurement theory and precision medicine concepts.
<br><br>
Our research aims to use <b>fundamental measurement principles</b> and <b>individual-centered methods</b> to advance <b>brain-behavior understanding and prediction</b>. To set the stage for this research program, we have developed approaches to improve detection of brain-behavior relationships based on our work characterizing measurement and signal properties. Furthermore, we have a longstanding commitment to providing <b>best practices for machine learning and big data analysis</b>, especially for predicting psychiatric and developmental outcomes. The overarching motivation for these goals is one that the field is growing to embrace: more precise inferential and predictive methods are needed to accelerate discovery in health and disease. Many neuroscience-related research areas have faced an explosion in the size and complexity of data and methods, and we aim to explore solutions to problems that span disciplines.
