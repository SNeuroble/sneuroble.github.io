The Neuroscience Precision Research & Idiographic Statistical Methods (NeuroPRISM) Lab, led by <a href="members">Dr. Stephanie Noble</a> in the <a href="https://cbh.northeastern.edu/">Center for Cognitive and Brain Health</a> at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>, creates computational and statistical tools for precision neuroscience research. Our use of "precision neuroscience" is intended to invoke both measurement theory and precision medicine concepts.
<br><br>
We aim to use <b>fundamental measurement principles</b> and <b>individual-centered methods</b> to advance <b>brain-behavior understanding and prediction</b>. To set the stage for this research program, we have developed approaches to improve detection of brain-behavior relationships based on our work characterizing measurement and signal properties. Furthermore, we have a longstanding commitment to providing <b>best practices for machine learning and big data analysis</b>, especially for predicting psychiatric and developmental outcomes. The overarching motivation for these goals is one that the field is growing to embrace: more precise inferential and predictive methods are needed to accelerate discovery in health and disease. Many neuroscience-related research areas have faced an explosion in the size and complexity of data and methods, and we aim to explore solutions to problems that span disciplines.

Previously, Dr. Noble received a BSE in Chemical & Biological Engineering from Princeton University, a PhD in the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program at Yale University, and completed Postdoctoral training in Radiology & Biomedical Imaging at Yale. Beyond academia, she co-founded EEG startup goBlue Labs and served a consultant for Source Signal Imaging (now part of Cortech Solutions) and Elite Warrior Identification. Dr. Nobleâ€™s work has been supported by a number of awards, including from the NSF and NIH, and her work has appeared in various journals including PNAS, Nature, and Neuron.
