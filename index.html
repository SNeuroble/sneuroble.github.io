## About me

I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at [Yale University Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging](https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/) working on computational and statistical tools that will help us conduct more reproducible research in human neuroscience. 
Much of my work has focused on characterizing reliability and validity of both network and activation mapping in fMRI. In addition, my research builds upon our emerging understanding of these topics to create tools that enable more accurate inference and benchmarking. The overarching motivation for these goals is one that the field is growing to embrace: more accurate research methods lead us closer to discovery in health and disease.
