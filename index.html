<!-- <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="+2"><b>About me</b></font></p> -->
<p align="justify">
I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/diagnosticradiology/">Yale University Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging</a> creating statistical tools for precision human neuroscience research, mentored by <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/dustin-scheinost">Dustin Scheinost</a>. 
<br><br>
My research aims to use <b>fundamental measurement principles</b> and <b>individual-centered methods</b> to advance <b>brain-behavior understanding and prediction</b>. To set the stage for this research program, I have developed approaches to improve detection of brain-behavior relationships based on my work characterizing measurement and signal properties. Furthermore, I have a longstanding commitment to providing <b>best practices for machine learning and big data analysis</b>, especially for predicting psychiatric and developmental outcomes. The overarching motivation for these goals is one that the field is growing to embrace: more precise inferential and predictive methods are needed to accelerate discovery in health and disease. Furthermore, human neuroscience is not the only area that has faced an explosion in the size and complexity of data and methods, and I aim to explore solutions to problems that span disciplines.
<br><br>
The foundation for this work began during my PhD in the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/INP/">Yale Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program</a> with <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/todd-constable">Todd Constable</a>.
My experiences also extend beyond academia: before the PhD, I was co-founding Chief Scientific Officer of goBlue Labs (<a href="https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/start-up_tries_to_tap_mind_power/">selected media</a> and <a href="https://www.cravingtoquit.com/">Craving to Quit</a> product; now <a href="https://www.starthub.org/startups/claritas-mindsciences">Mindsciences</a>), and a consultant for <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311720">Source Signal Imaging</a> (now part of <a href="https://cortechsolutions.com/">Cortech Solutions</a>). I am currently a consultant for <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_va/11128712">Elite Warrior Identification</a>.
