Our lab focuses on unraveling fundamental principles of brain measurement and developing statistical and machine learning models for individual-level insight.

**Research Staff (e.g., Research Assistant, Research Technician, Lab Manager)**

Apply <a href="https://northeastern.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/careers/job/Boston-MA-Main-Campus/Research-Technician_R116206">here</a>!

Research staff receive mentored experience in assisting in all aspects of running a computational neuroscience research lab, making it an excellent fit for individuals considering graduate school or non-academic research careers in computational psychology, biomedicine, and meta-research.

This position typically involves assisting in the management of computational lab infrastructure and datasets, conducting research activities (e.g., IRB writing, data procurement, management, analysis, and potential dissemination of results), supporting lab members in developing and running computational experiments, as well as manuscript and grant preparation, and gaining valuable experience in advanced quantitative methods, neuroimaging data, or pursue independent research projects.

Research staff typically hold a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Psychology, Neuroscience, Bioengineering, or a related discipline. A strong attention to detail, exceptional organizational skills, and a passion for developing computational abilities are desirable qualities in research staff. Successful individuals are also self-motivated, efficient, and able to work independently. Programming experience (Python, MATLAB, or R) and human neuroscience and/or psychology experience are typically helpful qualifications but not a requirement for success in this position.

**Postdoctoral Researchers**

Apply <a href="https://northeastern.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/careers/job/Boston-MA-Main-Campus/Postdoctoral-Research-Associate_R116179">here</a>!

Postdoctoral researchers receive mentored experience in developing and running research projects, with an emphasis on preparation to lead an independent research lab. Opportunities and training towards independence and ownership over research projects is a central feature of this position. Postdoctoral research projects will broadly involve the development of machine learning, statistics, or other computational methodologies for human neuroscience research.

Postdoctoral researchers with existing technical and quantitative research experience and the desire to lead projects related to the aforementioned topics will represent a strong fit with the objectives and training environment of the Neuro-PRISM lab. Postdoctoral researchers typically hold a PhD in Psychology, Neuroscience, Bioengineering, or a related field with demonstrated experience leading research relating to the above topics.
