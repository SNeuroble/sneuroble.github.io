Join our exciting computational neuroscience research team in the Neuroscience Precision Research & Idiographic Statistical Methods (NeuroPRISM) Lab!  Our mission is to unravel fundamental principles of brain measurement and develop statistical and machine learning models for individual-level insight.

**Postdoctoral Researchers**

\*\*_We are currently recruiting a postdoctoral researcher—please submit an application <a href="https://northeastern.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/careers/job/Boston-MA-Main-Campus/Postdoctoral-Research-Associate_R116179">here</a>_\*\*

Postdoctoral researchers receive mentored experience in developing and running research projects, with an emphasis on preparation to lead an independent research lab. Opportunities and training towards independence and ownership over research projects is a central feature of this position. Postdoctoral research projects will broadly involve the development of machine learning, statistics, or other computational methodologies for human neuroscience research.

Postdoctoral researchers with existing technical and quantitative research experience and the desire to lead projects related to the aforementioned topics will represent a strong fit with the objectives and training environment of the NeuroPRISM lab. Postdoctoral researchers typically hold a PhD in Psychology, Neuroscience, Bioengineering, or a related field with demonstrated experience leading research relating to the above topics. We particularly encourage individuals from historically underrepresented groups in science to apply.

**PhD Students**

\*\*_We are currently recruiting PhD students—please apply via the <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/psychology/">Northeastern Psychology</a> or <a href="https://bioe.northeastern.edu/"> Bioengineering</a> application sites_\*\*

PhD students receive mentored experience in computational and statistical neuroimaging research as well as guidance in conceptualizing and running independent research. Training towards independence over the course of the PhD journey is a central feature of this position, with an emphasis on preparation to lead computational neuroscience research projects in academia or industry. PhD student projects will broadly involve the development of machine learning, statistics, or other computational methodologies for human neuroscience research.

We will be reviewing applications for the Fall cycle submitted through the Departments of <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/psychology/">Psychology</a> and <a href="https://bioe.northeastern.edu/"> Bioengineering</a> at Northeastern. Please note that due to the large volume of requests, we may not be able to respond to all PhD student inquiries, but we will certainly have an opportunity to meet if you are invited to participate through the formal application submission process. 

Additional resources:

- Application fee waivers: you may be eligible for a fee waivers and/or reimbursement--click <a href="https://northeastern.my.site.com/CPSSupport/s/applicant">here</a> to learn more.
- GRE scores: Optional at Northeastern.
- Guidance: For more guidance on how to decide whether grad school might be right for you and how to put your best foot forward, see <a href="https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/applying-to-graduate-school-tips/">these tips from Northeastern</a> and <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.2029">this ESA guide that demystifies the application process</a>.
  - Insider tip: Want to maximize your chances of getting a response to your prospective student inquiry email? A clearly tailored email is more likely to get a response. See <a href="https://contemplativemammoth.com/2013/04/08/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-nail-the-inquiry-email/">here</a> and <a href="https://science-professor.blogspot.com/2011/10/writing-to-me-reprise.html">here</a> (the latter is a bit harsher than my own perspective, but helpful nonetheless) for tips on getting that right.

**Research Staff**

\*\*_We are **not** currently recruiting research staff but are open to inquiries regarding a data / computational resource management role_\*\*


_If you are interested in discussing potential opportunities in the lab, please reach out to Dr. Stephanie Noble at s.noble\<at\>northeastern.edu . (Note that due to the volume of requests we may not be able to respond to all inquiries.)_
