Join our innovative computational neuroscience research team at the Neuroscience Precision Research & Idiographic Statistical Methods (NeuroPRISM) Lab!  Our lab focuses on unraveling fundamental principles of brain measurement and developing statistical and machine learning models for individual-level insight.

**Postdoctoral Researchers**

Apply <a href="https://northeastern.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/careers/job/Boston-MA-Main-Campus/Postdoctoral-Research-Associate_R116179">here</a>!

Postdoctoral researchers receive mentored experience in developing and running research projects, with an emphasis on preparation to lead an independent research lab. Opportunities and training towards independence and ownership over research projects is a central feature of this position. Postdoctoral research projects will broadly involve the development of machine learning, statistics, or other computational methodologies for human neuroscience research.

Postdoctoral researchers with existing technical and quantitative research experience and the desire to lead projects related to the aforementioned topics will represent a strong fit with the objectives and training environment of the Neuro-PRISM lab. Postdoctoral researchers typically hold a PhD in Psychology, Neuroscience, Bioengineering, or a related field with demonstrated experience leading research relating to the above topics.

**PhD Student**

PhD students receive mentored experience in computational and statistical neuroimaging research as well as guidance in conceptualizing and run independent research. Training towards independence over the course of the PhD journey is a central feature of this position, with an emphasis on preparation to lead computational neuroscience research projects in academia or industry. PhD student projects will broadly involve the development of machine learning, statistics, or other computational methodologies for human neuroscience research.

We will be reviewing applications for the Fall cycle submitted through the departments of <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/psychology/">Psychology</a> and <a href="https://bioe.northeastern.edu/"> Bioengineering</a> at Northeastern. Please note that we may not be able to respond to all PhD student inquiries, but we will certainly have an opportunity to meet if you are invited to participate through the formal application submission process.

Application fee waivers: you may be eligible for a fee waivers and/or reimbursement--click <a href="https://northeastern.my.site.com/CPSSupport/s/applicant">here</a> to learn more.
GRE scores: Optional at Northeastern.
Guidance: For more guidance on how to decide whether grad school might be right for you and how to put your best foot forward, see <a href="https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/applying-to-graduate-school-tips/">these tips from Northeastern</a> and <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.2029">this ESA guide that demystifies the application process</a>.
